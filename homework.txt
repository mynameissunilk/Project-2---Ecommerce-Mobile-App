Features:
I: Allow user to search products in database & add wanted results to cart
-User should be able to browse an hierarchy of activities displaying items:
      Activity1: main page with  listoflists, i.e.: categories.
      Activity2: list of category items
      Activity3: item details

"As a user, I can choose from a list of categories on the main page to browse a list of items of the chosen category. "

"As a user, I can click an item in a category listing to bring its description up"
      
II: User should be able to use a searchbar to query the store for items 
"As a user, I can search the store inventory database usingh a specific query in a searchbar to check if the store has what I want."

III: Allow user to add/remove/modify products in a shopping cart
-cart will be a singleton 
-user can increase/decrease/remove items in cart
"As a user, I can add items to my shopping cart"
"As a user, I can change the quantity of items in my shopping cart, either by increasing the amount of items in my cart, or by decreasing it, or by entirely removing an entry." 

Bonus-ish
-create a class for a ShopItem/ItemListing/... maybe call it  Product?
-class will have member variables for title, description, price, boolean instock.
-all objects of this class will be associated with a product image
-all objects and their images will be represented as rows in a database called someting like "inventory.db"
-member methods will be getters, but probably not setters... customer is not always right. 

maybe:
recyclerview elements will represent a given row of inventory items including image, title, maybe description if i can make it look nice, and someting to indicate it's in stock.
